## This is my soultion for the famous kaggle competition, the titanic, in which we try to predict the surrvivors using Data Science. 

### In this project, we will go through three phases:
    1- Data exploring & cleaning
    2- Data anaylsis & finding realtionships
    3- Building ML model



# 1- Data exploring & cleaning:
  -  I tried to understand what each column represnt and its data type
  -  Explored the values more
  -  Replaced the missing values with the mean
# 2- Data anaylsis & finding realtionships
- Found the percent of alone passngers
- Determined the most critcal columns for surrviving, which are Pclass and Sex of the passenger 
- Found that Female at Pclass 1 had the most surrviving rate from the plots


# 3- Building ML model:
- Because this is a classification problem, i choose the KNN model
- By chaning the values of N, i found that n =4 gives the best accuracy
- Accuracy Based Train & Split method is 79.33%
# The solution for this problelm is explained in the Notebook's markdown along with my reasons. Make sure to check it out
